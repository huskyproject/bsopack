1. Introduction
---------------

BSOpack is used to pack outgoing netmail for links. It works with
HUSKY package and requires its files. You must use fidoconfig from
Oct 29 2000 or more fresh. If you don't have these packages, download them
from http://husky.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/


2. FidoConfig keywords and configuration
----------------------------------------

a) packNetmail <on/off>
	Determines if you want to pack outgoing netmail for this link.
        Used only in link definition.
  
b) maxUnpackedNetmail <size in kb>
	Determines how much unpacked netmail we should leave for this link.
        If we have more outgoing netmail - it will be packed.
        You also can have packed &  unpacked netmail in your outbound
        simultaneously - packet, which had had size more than maxUnpackedNetmail
        was packed into bundle and new packed with size less than
        maxUnpackedNetmail was created.
        If you select 0 kb - all netmail will be packed.
        
Attention: If you use 'packNetmail on' - you *must* define packer for this 
	link.

Example:

Link            Dmitry Sergienko
AKA             2:464/910
ourAka          2:464/910.1
Password        xxxxxxxx
LinkGrp         D
AccessGrp       D
Level           200
autoAreaCreate  on
autoFileCreate  on
forwardRequests on
AutoAreaCreateDefaults -lr 100 -lw 150 -g A -p 14 -dupeCheck move -dupeHistory 11
Packer          zip
allowEmptyPktPwd on
packNetmail on
maxUnpackedNetmail 0


3. Command line switches
------------------------

Usage: bsopack [-c fidconfig] [options]        
Options:
	-q            Quiet mode (ignoring screenloglevels in fidoconfig)
        -d            Debud mode
        -h or --help  Help screen

You can type several switches in one line like this: -qdc /etc/fido/config


4. How this program works
-------------------------

At first it checks if packNetmail for link is on, this link is not busy
and packer is defined. Then it searches for *.?ut files in outbound. if
size of all found *.?ut is more than maxUnpackedNetmail, this files will be
renamed to *.pkt (using tempOutbound token) and put into arcmail
bundle. So, your mail should never be lost. If any error occurs - hpt
scan will find this packet and (if this packet will be for link, listed in
fidoconfig) pack into bundle with echomail. Packet will be added to
last used bundle until size of bundle is more than 'arcmailSize' for
link. If you select 'bundleNameStyle addrDiff' your netmail will be
packed together with echomail. Each flavour is processed independently. 
It creates bundle names using algorithm of two addresses difference.
Log file 'bsopack.log' is placed into 'logFileDir'.

This program now supports only Win32 and Linux. Because I don't have other 
OSes, I cant' compile & test for other platforms.

Some parts of code was used & modified from hpt.
