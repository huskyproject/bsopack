.SH HOW IT WORKS
At first it checks if packNetmail for the link is on, if this link is not busy
and if a packer is defined. Then it searches for *.?ut files in the outbound. 
If the size of all found *.?ut is greater than maxUnpackedNetmail, these files
will be renamed to *.pkt (using tempOutbound token) and put into an arcmail
bundle. So, your mail should never be lost. If any error occurs hpt
scan will find this packet and (if this packet is for a link listed in
fidoconfig) pack it into a bundle with echomail. The packet will be added to
the most recently used bundle until the size of the bundle is greater than 
'arcmailSize' for the link. If you select 'bundleNameStyle addrDiff' your 
netmail will be packed together with echomail. Each flavour is processed 
independently. 
It creates bundle names using an algorithm of two addresses differences.
The log file 'bsopack.log' is placed into 'logFileDir'.
